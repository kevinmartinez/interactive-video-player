        7
        00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,880
        cable Internet, or a phone line if you

      </span>
      <span>
        8
        00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
        your house, that connects you to

        00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,430

        you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or
      </span>
      <span>
        11
        00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,190
        you might also use the telephone system.
